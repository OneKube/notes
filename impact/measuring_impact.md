 Impact investment: those that intentionally target social/env impact AND financial returns;

 Data must be measured, collected, analysed and reported in a meaningful manner;

 Contributions of impact investing done right:
  - Generate value to the impact investment stakeholders
  - Mobilize more investment by showing overall impact
  - Increase transparency and accountability 

	“Impact measurement convention” == “a standardized impact measurement and reporting system that enhances the availability 
of material, reliable, comparable, ’additional,’ and universal impact data”. 

- Impact is a complex and multi-facet environment:
Impact in a multi-actor system: Primary actor (those involved in movement of capital); Measurement and data service providers
and Ecosystem actors (those who apply the capital in the field -- entrepreneurs, executors)

Early stage impact investor: 'Too many resources on Impact measurement. Need for more concise and straight to the point 
resources'

- There are 4 phases of impact measurement: Plan,Do,Access,Review. The 7 best practices (above) take place;

- Readiness of investors and investees is important to insure efficient investment;
- "payment-for-success": when the startup achieves a certain degree of success, the investment increases;
- Collaboration between all stakeholders is essential: all stakeholders should work and influence towards better Impact
measures and collaborate to acquire data.

- Impact measurement is important for investors to access level of impact-risk and make investing decisions based on it;
- More difficult to collect data in developing countries due to small tech penetration (compared to more tech developed
countries)

Example of Impact metrics:
- Increase the proportion of employed ex-offenders by 5 percentage points (project: re-integrate ex-inmates)
- One Acre Fund: collect data about how the farmers in which the company invested have improved the yields over time;
Also number of farmers served, dollar and percentage increase in take home-farm income
- Oikocredit as an example of excellence in terms of Impact measurement

 How do big companies measure impact?
 	- Never directly
 	- Three different approaches in the article: How much education improvements will be beneficial to the 
 	final user; How many products reach the bottom of the pyramid; How much money and investment if brought
 	in the long run.
 	- Rather than discuss what should be measured in the impact companies, commit to long term research on
 	how to measure the impact.
