The main goal of the talk is to raise awareness about the importance for common internet users to protect their data and footprints online (e.g. metadata), in order to protect their privacy and freedom online. The twist is that the same
technologies that can protect our privacy and citizens at risk (political and digital dissidents, citizens at risk), is also powering the so called dark web. Thus, complementary goals are to 1) highlight that technology can be used for 
the good or bad, but that does not make it inherently good or bad, 2) protecting personal data and privacy means protecting everyone's rights and freedom and 3) thast it is easy to start using the technologies and contribute.

## Script

Good evening! Let me ask you how many of you here have accessed 
the dark web before? Oh, I see one, two, me. Not that many.. To be honest, I'd 
love to see many more hands raised! I know, it sounds weird, right? Isn't the
dark web the place where criminals do their businesses online!? But do you know 
what do oppositors of oppressive regimes, people concerned with their personal 
privacy and for example, the child pornography industry have in common? They are
all using the same technology to access the internet anonymously. Exactly, the
same technologies that are used by criminals to buy and sell drugs online are also 
empowering social progressive agendas and protect citizens' private life.

It's easy to understand why between fear and skepticism, we usually miss the 
point that the same technology that allows the so called dark web to thrive, 
can also help us to
protect our data from bad actors and corporations. I know that the dark web is a
scary topic. However, there is a lot of misinformation and preconception about 
the dark web and its technologies. At this point you are probably thinking 
... **joke** ...

I'm pretty sure that you are imagining the dark web as a sketchy place. And you 
are right! There are online drug stores aplenty and anyone can easily find 
stolen credit card on sale, for example. However, I'm not an 
advocate of the illegal businesses going on the dark web. I'm here show how we
all can use dark web technology to protect ourselves. I want to show you
that at the end of the day, the technology is just a tool. It can be used for 
good or bad, and it's up to us decide how to use it.

I'm pretty sure that at this point, you are really skeptical about all of this.
So today I'd like to address the skepticism around this subject. We will discuss
the difference between the dark web and the technologies that enable it. And why
you should even considering using them. Hopefully towards the end you will agree
with me that using dark web technologies on a daily basis can be beneficial for
you and our society, so I will quickly give you some tips on how to get you
plugged in.

###  What is the darkweb

> Feedback: I know that people don't care if they don't understand, so...

But let's start with the first question: what is the dark web and what 
technologies make it possible and why, exactly?

You can see the dark web just like the internet that we are used to. However, it
can be accessed only with specific software and configurations which allows you
to become practically anonymous when using the internet. Moreover, it also
allows you access to websites - the called hidden services - that are not listed
in the usual search engines, like Google.

Under this definition, there are multiple dark webs in use nowadays.
However the most popular dark web is enabled by the Tor	software. Tor - standing
for The Onion Router - is a software that provides its users a strong layer of 
anonymity by hiding all data from its users and websites. 

Basically, accessing the internet through Tor is not different from what we are
all used to. The easiest way to access it is to install a pre-configured browser
and that's pretty much it. So let's see how the Tor software works.

> Feedback: maybe a bridge here?

But first, meet Bob.

**show slide**

Bob is just like anyone of us. He's been using the internet for a long time and 
part of his morning routine is to drink a coffee while reading the news at 
www.news.com website.

**show slide**

News.com Co. is using a bunch of trackers that get a lot of information about
Bob's behavior on the website. Information about his location, devices in which
he accesses the webpage, what content he usually checks, etc. All this data can
be used to put together an incredible accurate profile of Bob, his political 
affiliations, ideology, family status, etc.. Although everyone trust New.com 
Co., no one is really sure if the company will eventually be acquired by some
one less trustworthy, or if the company may be hacked and all Bob's information
will be sold to criminals. Anyways, Bob might not even be aware that News.com
has all this information about himself.

**show slide**

Not only News.com can get personal and sensitive data about Bob. The government
and other actors can also tap into the communication between Bob and New.com. As
a matter of fact, they can tap into the communication between Bob and any other
website and app. 

**show slide**

Basically, only by visiting the websites and using apps, Bob is leaking his 
personal data and being tracked by many different entities. Those entities
create and store an accurate profile of Bob.

> Feedback: list of tracking in one slide and give more importance to it. Maybe
> briefly tell about real cases that happened

> Feedback: list of 'entities' that might be interested in our private data and
> reasons for that 

**show slide**

One day, Bob watched a TEDx talk about the dark web and the Tor network. He got
more aware of how he was being exposed nowadays to personal data leaks and he
decided to start using Tor. For that, he installed the Tor browser and, as
usual, visited his favorite news.com website.

**show slide**

But this time, news.com doesn't really know that the request comes from Bob,
because the Tor network shuffles his request within many different computers in
the network. This makes it impossible for the news.com website to track and
collect Bob's data/

**show slide**

> Feedback: Anyone who tries to track Bob's behavior 

Others also got confused because they see that Bob is only sending requests to
one address. For all the websites Bob visits, he's sending his request through
the Tor network. This makes it impossible for governments and bad actors to
understand what is Bob up to. 

**show slide**

The basic idea is that the all connections will go through the Tor 
network, which will shuffle them. So it becomes almost impossible to understand 
who is accessing what, making it hard for websites and bad actors to track users
and discriminate them based on their profile or use that information in harmful 
ways.

With this simple example, it's clear that all we need to start protecting our 
personal data is to install and use a special browser. It's also clear that
being connected to the internet with Tor allows you to visit normal websites you 
are used to, instead of any sketchy dark web and criminal website. Many of those
criminal websites are not even listed on the normal search engines such as
google. So you won't just stumble upon them any ways.

It is easy to understand why the Tor network is the preferred way for criminals
to operate. But then again, technologies are not intrinsically good of bad, it
all depends on how it is used. And researches have shown that the big bulk of
the traffic that goes through the Tor network is connecting to legit
non-criminal websites. So, not only Tor can protect your online data, it's
already doing it for many people!

## Why should you use Tor?

So now that we know what the dark web is and that there is a difference between
technologies that enable it and its use, the next question is why should you
even care? This is, in my opinion, the most interesting part of the discussion.

In a nutshell, the reason why you should use Tor is privacy, personal protection
and economics. But let's see in more detail few reasons why you should use the
same technology that powers the dark web for yours and society's benefits.

The first reason is that internet providers and governments have the tools and
the will to track online behavior of users and citizens, respectively.
This is a fact and it was demonstrated by the documents leaked by Snowden and
Manning about internet surveillance programs carried out by the US and EU intelligent
services. You may trust your government and thus not be concerned about the
fact that your government is able to collect all your online activity - and of
your families. Remember though, that the data is not only collected but also
stored, and with the current volatility in our society, are we able to ensure
that sensitive data about ourselves and our families will not be used against us
in the future by some sketchy people that got to govern us? We do not need nor
have to take that risk.

Another reason is essentially that our lives are more connected than ever. The
danger of having more devices in our home connected to the internet is that it
opens doors to surveillance and targeted attacks. Unfortunately there have been
cases of attackers being able to speak to a baby through babycam which is
connected to the internet.
Apart from those targeted attacks, the fact that we are more connected than even
gives companies and malintented organizations the capabilities to
harvest more and more data about our private data. Where do we usually access
the internet? Which websites do we use the most? What are our interests? Which
services do we use? All this data can be easily harvested and ultimately put
together to make a accurate profile of who we are. This data can easily be used
for business purposes without our consent, discrimination and criminal purposes.

Technologies like Tor create a privacy layer which allows you to protect your
online privacy and sensitive data leaks.

The 3rd point I'd like to make is economics. Using these technologies is
basically making illicit data harvesting hard. So hard that it becomes nonviable
to do so. It's all about economics: if we all make it hard for attackers and
companies to illegally gather people's data, then it becomes just too
expensive for them to do so. It becomes too expensive for companies like
Cambridge Analytica to profile people's based on their data
in order to change the course of democratic elections. Or it becomes really
expensive for rogue governments to spy on their citizens looking for
opportunities to silent regime or moral oppositors. Same goes for hackers who
are selling your data to the highest bidder.
If enough people turn their privacy shields on, then all that business model
will just not work and our society gives a step forward!
So it becomes almost an ethically and moral imperative to protect your personal data.
Not only for yourself, but for a fairer and more secure online society.

If you are still not convinced and you still don't see a reason why you nor
anyone else should use technologies that hide user's online activity,
think about the journalists, whistle blowers, political dissidents, NGOs and
other citizens at risk that use Tor to communicate and share information safely,
without being traced by potential rogue governments or any malintended actors.
In those cases, it is life threatening to use the internet without the
privacy and security provided by Tor.

### How can you benefit from those technologies

At this point you are asking yourself how can I join Bob and use Tor for my own
benefit? 

> Feedback: Using the dark web to protect your data is not the difficult part: 
> just go ahead and google how to download the Tor browser. Changing the bad 
> practices online is the difficult part.

<slide>
A very good starting point is the Security Planner guide by The Citizen Lab 
from the University of Toronto. There you can find really easy explanations on
how to install Tor on your laptop and mobile phone. And because Tor does not 
solve all online privacy and security problems, you can also find much more 
information about encrypting your connections, safe password management, etc.

### Wrap up

By now, I truly hope you more afraid than 15m ago of the interconnected world we
live in
and the immense possibilities for our personal data to be exploited and used
against us and our society. That is a good thing, since from fear comes action!
Now that we all know how to better protect our sensitive and personal data
online, let's take a step forward and leverage the technologies that enable the 
dark web, in our own benefit. And let's remember that any 
technology is just a tool! Instead of being afraid of its misuse, it's up 
to us to use them in a way that takes society forward in terms of freedom, 
privacy and security.

Thank you!

- I don't have any real case scenario about how data tracking by websites and
  governments/hackers can be really bad. Add it?


## Notes/ideas/etc..

Without Tor, the streets of the internet become like the streets of a very
heavily surveilled city. [...] With Tor, we have private spaces and private 
lives. —Edward Snowden 

- fear of retribution (whitleblowers, activits, journalists)
- censorship (organizational/national level)
- privacy
- tracking and data mining
- irresponble and vulnerable devices
- state and corporation surveilance
- anonymous
- anti-tracking 
- trackers can reveal identity, health, income, economical and personal
  situation information (e.g. pregnant, with children, etc..) and which places
	do you visit the most, where's your home
- mass surveilance
- the importance of metadata "Michael Hayden (NSA-Director): "We kill People based on Metadata""


- technologies that power the dark web BUT you should use:
	- Tor
	- VPN
	- bitcoin

- others important
	- DuckDuckGo

- some mistakes from my short talk:
	- darkweb is not good though
	- technology is good
