## Intro

What does the child pronography industry, oppositors of oppressive regimes and 
their families, drug dealers and people concerned with personal privacy have in 
common? They are all using the same technology to access the internet 
anonymously. The same technology that allows criminals to buy and sell drugs 
online is also powering social progressive agendas and protecting citizens'
private life.

The technologies that enable criminals to operate and which power the so called
dark web, are the same technologies that have the potential to protect citizens
from rogue states, data harvesting from corporations, protect privacy and free
speech and, ultimately, freedom.

## Goals of the talk
Most of the times when talking with people about the same technologies that are
used in the dark web, people react with fear and loathing. The first questions
and concerns are whether it is illegal or whether they will
stumble upon shaddy websites right away.

> how about talking about the web browser (with Tor) as a gateway for the darkweb
> to make it easirt for everyone to understand

The interesting thing
about the technologies that power the dark web is that they are probably the
best way to preserve people's privacy and ...

It is easy to demonize technology based on its use. But it is important to
understand also how the same technology can be used to society's benefit. That's
our goal for today(...)!
 

## What is the darkweb

> "Breath in and bear with me" kinda of intro to this section. To make people

But first, what is the dark web?

(in wikipedia)
A darknet (or dark net) is any overlay network that can be accessed only with 
specific software, configurations, or authorization, often using non-standard 
communication protocols and ports. An example of a dark net is the privacy
protecting network formed by Tor users and services.

## What technologies power the dark web
The dark web users and services rely on a set of technologies. Those
technologies allow users to be anonymous and untraceable.

For example. Tor can protect you from traffic analysis. Traffic analysis
consists of tracking your online bahaviour based on the websites and services
you use, and from which location. With this information, websites are able to
discriminate you, corporations may acquire information about you and your family
that you may not feel confortable with and governaments may

Tor can protect your metadata. Metadata consists of ... 
At first, metadata harvesting might not seem dangerous but ...
As Michael Hayden, former NSA-Director once said, "We kill People based on Metadata"

Thus to this characteristics, Tor is effective against internet censorship, in
which users can access destination and content which would be restricted by
governaments or ISPs.

Journalists, whiteleblowers, political dissidents, NGOs, use Tor to communicate
and share information safely, without being traced by potential rogue
governaments or enemies.

Tor does not solve all the problems. It only protects the transport of data.


## How can you benefit from those technologies

Why is data harvesting important? <example vegetarians>

As our lives become more connected than even, corporations and malintented
organizations have the capabilities to harvest more and more data about our
private data. Where do we usually access the internet? Which websites do we use 
the most? What are our interests? Which services do we use? All this data can be
easily harvested and ultimately put together to make a realisitc map of who we
are. This data can easily be used for business purposes, discrimination and or
criminal purposes.

It's easier than ever for personal information to be collected and exploited by 
ad companies and other corporations. Almost half of all websites roughly 99% of 
popular news sites have tracking software installed on their 
webpages [1][2]. These trackers can reveal your identity, health and income
data, or where you live. 

End-to-end encription is equaly important. Unfortunately, we cannot rely on
current websites and apps to do that for us.

Another important point for using these technologies is to make ilicit data
harvesting so harder that it becomes inviable. It's all about economics: if hackers and
big companies cannot harvest illegally people's data because it is protected,
then it becomes just too expensive for them to do so. It becomes too expensive
for companies like Cambridge Analytica to profile people's based on their data
in order to change the course of democraric elections. Or it becomes realy
expensive for rogue governaments to spy on their citizens looking for
opportunities to silent regime or moral oppositors. Same goes for hackers who 
are selling your data to god knows who.
If enough people turn on their privacy shields on, then all those business
models will not make sense and our society gives a step forward!
So it becomes almost an ethically and moral imperative to protect your personal data. 
Not only for yourself, but for a fairer and more secure online society.

And how can you do it? With the help of technologies that -- unfortunately --
also power the dark web.


## Concrete steps on how to use the technologies that power the dark web for your benefit

So at this point you are asking yourself: what practical steps can I take in
order to start protecting myself, my family and use these great technologies?

A very good guide by The Citizen Lab from the University of Toronto called
Security Planner (https://securityplanner.org/) <show in slides>. There you can
find really good guides and easy guides to help youi protect your data and setup
the Tor browsers in your desktop and Android or Apple device.

## Wrap up

The technologies that power the dark web are exactly that: technologies. 
Instead of being afraid of their misuse, it's up to us to use them in a way that
takes society forward in terms of freedom, privacy and security.

### Notes

Without Tor, the streets of the internet become like the streets of a very
heavily surveilled city. [...] With Tor, we have private spaces and private 
lives. â€”Edward Snowden 

- fear of retribution (whitleblowers, activits, journalists)
- censorship (organizational/national level)
- privacy
- tracking and data mining
- irresponble and vulnerable devices
- state and corporation surveilance
- anonymous
- anti-tracking 
- trackers can reveal identity, health, income, economical and personal
  situation information (e.g. pregnant, with children, etc..) and which places
	do you visit the most, where's your home
- mass surveilance
- the importance of metadata "Michael Hayden (NSA-Director): "We kill People based on Metadata""


- technologies that power the dark web BUT you should use:
	- Tor
	- VPN
	- bitcoin

- others important
	- DuckDuckGo

- some mistakes from my short talk:
	- darkweb is not good though
	- technology is good
