The main goal of the talk is to raise awareness about the importance for common
internet users to protect their data and footprints online (e.g. metadata), in 
order to protect their privacy and freedom online. The twist is that the same
technologies that can protect our privacy and citizens at risk (political and
digital dissidents, citizens at risk), is also powering the so called dark web.
Thus, complementary goals are to 1) highlight that technology can be used for 
the good or bad, but that does not make it inherently good or bad, 2) protecting
 personal data and privacy means protecting everyone's rights and freedom and 3)
 it is easy to start using the technologies and contribute.

## Script

What does the child pronography industry and oppositors of oppressive regimes or 
citizens concerned with personal privacy have in common? They are all using the 
same technology to access the internet anonymously to protect themselves. The 
same technology that allows criminals to buy and sell drugs online is also 
powering social progressive agendas and protecting citizens' private life.

The technologies that enable criminals to operate and which power the so called
dark web, are the same technologies that have the potential to protect citizens
from rogue states, data harvesting from corporations, protect privacy and free
speech and, ultimately, freedom.

### Goals of the talk

It has never been easy to talk about this subject because of the misinformation 
about the darkweb and its technologies and mostly the difference between them. 

Often, when I tell friends and non so technical people that they
should be accessing the web through technologies that are used to access the 
dark web for protecting their privacy, I'm not surprised  with reactions of fear,
confusion and even disgust.

One of their main concern is if whether using those technologies is illegal. 
Or even more important, if they will stumble upon drug ads and child pronography
material right away. By the way, the quick answers are no and no. We will soon 
dive deeper into those questions and much more. 

Followed by the initial surprise, the questions start popping out. It's 
interesting to notice that the pattern is usually the same: first, what is the 
dark web and what technologies are enabling it. The follow up questions after 
understanding better the technical side, is the why. Why should I - or anyone 
besides criminals - use those technologies. Finally, the discussion 
ends most of the time with an how - how to use the same technologies that power 
the dark web on a daily basis. 

The conversation goes from surprise and hesitation to curiosity and wilingness
to learn more about how to use the technologies that power the dark web for
personal - and even for society's - benefit. So today we will try to answer
those very same questions - what is the dark web, why should you use the
technologies that power the dark web and finally, how to do so.

###  What is the darkweb

Let's start with the first question: what is the dark web and the technologies
that power them?

A dark web is an internet that can be accessed only with specific software and 
configurations. The specific software and configurations hide the footprints of 
users and webpages. Basically, it allows users to access the internet
anonymous as it becomes really hard to track what webpages and apps they've been
visiting. This is the reason why those technologies are compeeling to criminals,
as well as people concerned with their privacy online.

The dark web users and services rely on a set of technologies that allow users 
to be anonymous and untraceable. An example of a dark web is the privacy 
protecting network formed by Tor users and services. Tor - standing for The 
Onion Router - is one of the main technologies enabling anonymous communication 
between users and services. 

From a practical perspective, - from your perspective - you just need to replace
your web browser (say, internet explorer/chrome/safari) by a browser that routes
the web traffic through the Tor network. That's it. You then go ahead and browse through the same 
websites than before and keep using the internet as always. This time though, you are 
assured that no one can track your behaviour online without your consent. 
There are other ways to route the traffic through the Tor network so that not
only your sites activity is protected, but also which apps you are using and
which devices at your home are connected to the internet. At the end of the talk,
I will give you more hints about how to get that done too!

To understand how can Tor protect our data - as well as being used for the dark
web - let's briefly take a look on how it works.

But first, please take a few moments to breath and bear with me through the next
more technical 5 minutes. Technical details are complicated and not always 
black and white and even the experts and maintainers of these technologies 
recognise the complexity of these. Let's really briwfly try to understand how
Tor works.

> Tor brief tech explanation

Tor can protect you from traffic analysis. Traffic analysis consists of tracking
your online bahaviour based on the websites and services you use, and from 
which location. With this information, websites are able to discriminate you, 
corporations may acquire information about you and your family that you may not 
feel confortable with and governaments may

Tor can protect your metadata. Metadata consists of ... 
At first, metadata harvesting might not seem dangerous but ...
As Michael Hayden, former NSA-Director once said, "We kill People based on Metadata"

Thus to this characteristics, Tor is effective against internet censorship, in
which users can access destination and content which would be restricted by
governaments or ISPs.

End-to-end encription is equaly important. Unfortunately, we cannot rely on
current websites and apps to do that for us.

## Why should you use Tor?

So now that we know more about what the dark web is and how it is different 
from the technologies that enable it, such as Tor, the next question is why 
should you care about them? This is, in my opinion, the most interesting part of
 the discussion.

The first reason is that internet providers and governaments have the tools and
the will to track the online behaviour of its users and citizens, respectively.
This is a fact and it was demonstrated by the documents leaked by Snowden and
Manning about internet surveillance programs carried out by the US and EU intelligent
services. While you may not be concerned about the fact that your governament may
be able to collect all your online activity - and of your families - because you
trust it, remember that the data is not only collected but also stored. With the
current volatility in our society, are we able to ensure that sensitive data 
about ourselves and our families will not be used against us in the future? We 
do not and should not have to take that risk.

Another reason is essentially that our lives are more connected than ever. The
so called internet of things revolution and smart devices just came to increase 
the amount of sensitive data leaks, which we are not even aware of.
> Concrete example here
This gives companies and malintented organizations the capabilities to 
harvest more and more data about our private data. Where do we usually access 
the internet? Which websites do we use the most? What are our interests? Which 
services do we use? All this data can be easily harvested and ultimately put 
together to make a accurate profile of who we are. This data can easily be used 
for business purposes without our consent, discrimination and or criminal 
purposes. 
For example, It's easier than ever for personal information to be collected and exploited by 
ad companies and other corporations. Almost half of all websites roughly 99% of 
popular news sites have tracking software installed on their 
webpages [1][2]. These trackers can reveal your identity, health and income
data, or where you live. 

The 3rd point I'd like to make is economics. Using these technologies is 
basically making ilicit data harvesting hard. So hard that it becomes inviable
to do so. It's all about economics: if hackers and big companies cannot harvest 
illegally people's data because it is protected,
then it becomes just too expensive for them to do so. It becomes too expensive
for companies like Cambridge Analytica to profile people's based on their data
in order to change the course of democraric elections. Or it becomes realy
expensive for rogue governaments to spy on their citizens looking for
opportunities to silent regime or moral oppositors. Same goes for hackers who 
are selling your data to the highest bidder.
If enough people turn on their privacy shields on, then all those business
models will not make sense and our society gives a step forward!
So it becomes almost an ethically and moral imperative to protect your personal data. 
Not only for yourself, but for a fairer and more secure online society.

If you are still not convinced and you still don't see a reason why you nor
anyone else should use technologies that allow them to be anonymous online,
think about the journalists, whiteleblowers, political dissidents, NGOs and
other citizens at risk that use Tor to communicate and share information safely,
 without being traced by potential rogue governaments or any malintended actors
- such as paid hackers. 

### How can you benefit from those technologies

(..) So at this point you are asking yourself: what practical steps can I take in
order to start protecting myself, my family and use these technologies?

Tor does not solve all the problems. It only protects the transport of data.

And how can you do it? With the help of technologies that -- unfortunately --
also power the dark web.

A very good guide by The Citizen Lab from the University of Toronto called
Security Planner (https://securityplanner.org/) <show in slides>. There you can
find really good guides and easy guides to help youi protect your data and setup
the Tor browsers in your desktop and Android or Apple device.

### Wrap up

The technologies that power the dark web are exactly that: technologies. 
Instead of being afraid of their misuse, it's up to us to use them in a way that
takes society forward in terms of freedom, privacy and security.

## Notes/ideas/etc..

Without Tor, the streets of the internet become like the streets of a very
heavily surveilled city. [...] With Tor, we have private spaces and private 
lives. —Edward Snowden 

- fear of retribution (whitleblowers, activits, journalists)
- censorship (organizational/national level)
- privacy
- tracking and data mining
- irresponble and vulnerable devices
- state and corporation surveilance
- anonymous
- anti-tracking 
- trackers can reveal identity, health, income, economical and personal
  situation information (e.g. pregnant, with children, etc..) and which places
	do you visit the most, where's your home
- mass surveilance
- the importance of metadata "Michael Hayden (NSA-Director): "We kill People based on Metadata""


- technologies that power the dark web BUT you should use:
	- Tor
	- VPN
	- bitcoin

- others important
	- DuckDuckGo

- some mistakes from my short talk:
	- darkweb is not good though
	- technology is good
