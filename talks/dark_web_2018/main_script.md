The main goal of the talk is to raise awareness about the importance for common internet users to protect their data and footprints online (e.g. metadata), in order to protect their privacy and freedom online. The twist is that the same
technologies that can protect our privacy and citizens at risk (political and digital dissidents, citizens at risk), is also powering the so called dark web. Thus, complementary goals are to 1) highlight that technology can be used for 
the good or bad, but that does not make it inherently good or bad, 2) protecting personal data and privacy means protecting everyone's rights and freedom and 3) thast it is easy to start using the technologies and contribute.

Good evening! Let me ask how many of you know what the dark web is? Ok, cool, some people… From these, how many of you have accessed it? Oh, I see one, two, me. Not that many.. To be honest, I'd really like to see many more hands raised! I know, it sounds weird, right? Isn't the dark web the place where criminals do their businesses online!?

That might be true, but do you know what do opponents of oppressive regimes, people concerned with their personal privacy and for example, the child pornography industry have in common? They are all using the same technology to access the internet anonymously. Exactly, the same technologies that are used by criminals to buy and sell drugs online are also empowering social progressive agendas and protecting people's private life online.

It's easy to understand why between fear and skepticism, we usually miss the point that the same technology that allows the so called dark web to thrive, can also help us to protect our data from bad actors and corporations. I know that the dark web is a scary topic. However, there is a lot of misinformation and preconception about the dark web and its technologies.

I'm pretty sure that you are imagining the dark web as a sketchy place. And you are right! There are online drug stores aplenty and anyone can easily find stolen credit card on sale, for example. However, I'm not an advocate of the illegal businesses going on the dark web. I'm here show how we all can use dark web technology to protect ourselves. I want to show you that at the end of the day, the technology is just a tool. It can be used for good or bad, and it's up to us decide how to use it.

I'm pretty sure that at this point, you are really skeptical about the fact that the dark web should be used by all of us. I'd like today to address the skepticism and debunk some myths about the dark web. We will discuss the difference between the dark web and the technologies that enable it. And why you should even considering using them. Hopefully towards the end you will agree with me that using dark web technologies on a daily basis can be beneficial for you and our society, so I will quickly give you some tips on how to get you plugged in.


But let's start with the first question: what is the dark web and what technologies make it possible?

You can see the dark web just like the internet that we are used to. However, it can be accessed only with specific software and configurations which allows you to become practically anonymous when using the internet. It also allows you access to websites that are not listed in the usual search engines, like Google.

Under this definition, there are multiple dark webs in use nowadays. However the most popular dark web is enabled by the Tor software. Tor - standing for The Onion Router - is a software that provides its users a strong layer of anonymity by hiding all data from its users and websites.

Basically, accessing the internet through Tor is not different from what we are all used to. The easiest way to access it is to install a pre-configured browser and that's pretty much it. So now let's see how the Tor software works with an example. 

show slide 

Meet Bob.

show slide 

Bob is just like anyone of us. He's been using the internet for a long time and part of his morning routine is to drink a coffee while reading the news at www.news.com website.

show slide 

News.com is using a bunch of trackers that get a lot of information about Bob's behavior on the website. Information about his location, devices in which he accesses the webpage, what content he usually checks, etc. We will see why is it a problem soon. 

show slide 

Not only News.com can get personal and sensitive data about Bob. The governments and hackers can also tap into the communication between Bob and News.com. As a matter of fact, they can tap into the communication between Bob and any other website and app.

show slide 

Basically, only by visiting the websites and using apps, Bob is leaking his personal data and being tracked by many different entities. Those entities create and store an accurate profile of Bob. All this data can be used to put together an incredibly accurate profile of Bob, his political affiliations, ideology, family status, etc.. Although everyone trusts News.com, no one is really sure if the company will eventually be acquired by some one less trustworthy, or if the company may be hacked and all Bob's information will be sold to criminals. Anyways, Bob might not even be aware that News.com has all this information about himself. - simplify

show slide 

One day, Bob watched a TEDx talk about the dark web and the Tor network. He got more aware of how he was being exposed nowadays to personal data leaks and he decided to start using Tor. For that, he installed the Tor browser and, as usual, visited his favorite news.com website.

show slide 

But this time, news.com doesn't really know that the request comes from Bob, because the Tor network shuffles his request within many different computers in the network. This makes it impossible for the news.com website to track and collect Bob's data/

show slide 

Government and hackers also get confused because for them it seems like Bob is only sending requests to one address. For all the websites Bob visits, he's sending his request through the Tor network. This makes it impossible for them to understand what Bob is up to.

The basic idea is that the all connections will go through the Tor network, which will shuffle them. So it becomes almost impossible to harvest user data online.

With this example it's clear that all we need to do to start protecting our personal data is to install and use a special browser. This browser will allow you to access the normal internet. And you won’t just stumble upon criminal websites as long as you don’t put a lot of effort finding them, since they are not even listed on google.  

It is easy to understand why the Tor network is the preferred way for criminals to operate. But then again, technologies are not intrinsically good or bad, it all depends on how it is used. And research has shown that the big bulk of the traffic that goes through the Tor network is connecting to legit non-criminal websites. So, not only Tor can protect your online data, it's already doing it for many people!

But why should you care? One thing is for certain: we are leaking a lot of data about us and our behavior. Over time as we’ve seen it’s possible for governments and corporations to build a profile about us and our lives.

For instance, think about recent cases on how personal and private data was used to influence elections in America.

Or take example of Turkey. Turkish government has been prosecuting people who have been using a certain messaging app. The main reason was because they believed that people who used this app were associated with the failed coup. Interestingly though, there was a virus that was spreading among people, which would access this app without them knowing. This made government imprison a lot of innocent people. This what happens when we give a lot of power…… 

Technologies like Tor create a privacy layer which allows you to protect your online privacy and avoid sensitive data leaks. These technologies also help people to circumvent state censorship and help people to remain anonymous while fighting for their rights - either as a journalist reporting on human right violations or as a political dissident fighting for a fairer society.

 Many people and activists have raised concerns about the current state of the internet and what it mean for our privacy. Edward Snowden who worked for the CIA and revealed the American and European internet surveillance programs actually said: "Without Tor, the streets of the internet become like the streets of a very heavily surveilled city. [...] With Tor, we have private spaces and private lives." 

Basically, these technologies have the power to put us back in control about what personal information do we want to disclose and to whom. 

As individuals, by protecting our private data we are effectively protecting our freedom of speech and right for privacy. Collectively, protecting our data has a powerful effect that can be a game changer. It's all about economics: if we make it really hard and expensive for corporations and governments to harvest our online data, the whole business model based on our personal and private data becomes nonviable. In such a world, the society takes a huge step forward towards a less discriminatory society where everyone's privacy is protected.

It is really hard to have a clear picture of what type of data is being disclosed and to whom - one of the threats - maybe in the slide about “what bad can happen”?

So how can you start protecting your data with Tor? A very good starting point is the Security Planner guide by The Citizen Lab from the University of Toronto. There you can find really easy explanations on how to install Tor on your laptop and mobile phone. And because Tor does not solve all online privacy and security problems, you can also find much more about how to effectively protect your personal data. Using these technologies is usually quite straightforward. The hard part is usually to change our bad habits.

By now, I hope you are afraid of the interconnected world we live in and the immense possibilities for our personal data to be exploited and used against us and our society. That is a good thing, because from fear comes action! Now that we all know how to better protect our sensitive and personal data online, let's take a step forward and leverage the technologies that enable the dark web, in our own benefit. And let's remember that any technology is just a tool! Instead of being afraid of its misuse, it's up to us to use them in a way that takes society forward in terms of freedom, privacy and security.

Thank you!

lives. —Edward Snowden 

- fear of retribution (whitleblowers, activits, journalists)
- censorship (organizational/national level)
- privacy
- tracking and data mining
- irresponble and vulnerable devices
- state and corporation surveilance
- anonymous
- anti-tracking 
- trackers can reveal identity, health, income, economical and personal
  situation information (e.g. pregnant, with children, etc..) and which places
	do you visit the most, where's your home
- mass surveilance
- the importance of metadata "Michael Hayden (NSA-Director): "We kill People based on Metadata""


- technologies that power the dark web BUT you should use:
	- Tor
	- VPN
	- bitcoin

- others important
	- DuckDuckGo

- some mistakes from my short talk:
	- darkweb is not good though
	- technology is good
