## Meta

```
The main goal of the talk is to raise awareness about the importance for common internet users to protect their data and footprints online (e.g. metadata), in order to protect their privacy and freedom online. The twist is that the same
technologies that can protect our privacy and citizens at risk (political and digital dissidents, citizens at risk), is also powering the so called dark web. Thus, complementary goals are to 1) highlight that technology can be used for 
the good or bad, but that does not make it inherently good or bad, 2) protecting personal data and privacy means protecting everyone's rights and freedom and 3) thast it is easy to start using the technologies and contribute.

Good evening! So, how many of you have ever heard about the dark web? Alright, some people… From these, how many of you have accessed it? I see one, two, me. Not that many.. To be honest, I'd really like to see many more hands raised! I know this sounds weird.. Many people know the dark web as the place for criminals to do their businesses online.
That is true, but the fact is that both child pornography industry and normal people concerned with their personal privacy are using the same technology to protect themselves. The technologies that are used by criminals to buy and sell drugs online are also empowering social progressive agendas and protecting people's private life online.
I know that the dark web is a scary topic. When I first learned about it, I had mixed feelings of curiosity and fear. Over time, I understood that there is a lot of misinformation and preconception about the the dark web and its technologies. As I became more concerned with the way my personal data is being harvested and used online, I started to look at the dark web technologies as an answer to an important problem: that we are all leaking way too much information about ourselves and our behaviour online, with potential bad consequences to us and our society.

You may imagine the dark web as a sketchy place. And you are right! There are plenty of online drug stores and anyone can easily find stolen credit card for sale, for example. However, I'm not an advocate of the illegal businesses going on the dark web. I'm here to show how we all can use dark web technology to protect ourselves. At the end of the day, the technology is just a tool. It can be used for good or bad, and it's up to us decide how to use it.
Probably, you too are skeptical about the idea of using the dark web. I'd like to address the skepticism and discuss the difference between the dark web and the technologies that enable it and why you should even considering using them. Hopefully towards the end you will agree with me that using dark web technologies on a daily basis can be beneficial for you and our society, so I will quickly give you some tips on how to get you plugged in.

But let's start by exploring what is the dark web and what technologies make it possible.
You can see the dark web just like the internet that we are used to. However, it can be accessed only with specific software and configurations which allows you to become practically anonymous when using the internet. It also allows you access to websites that are not listed in the usual search engines, like Google.
show slide (Tor)
Under this definition, there are multiple dark webs nowadays. However the most popular dark web is enabled by the Tor software. Tor - standing for The Onion Router - is a software that provides its users a strong layer of anonymity by hiding all data from its users and websites. Tor was originally created by the US military with the primary purpose of protecting government communications, but it has become an open source project used by millions of people.
Basically, accessing the internet through Tor is not different from what we are used to. It is quite simple to start using the Tor network, all you need to do is to install and use the Tor browser. Let's see how the Tor network can help protecting our private data with Bob's example.
show slide (Bob)
This is Bob!
show slide (Bob and news.com)
Bob has been using the internet for a long time and part of his morning routine is to drink a coffee while reading the news at www.news.com website.
show slide (Bob and news.com trackers)
When Bob access news.com, a bunch of trackers are gathering lot of information about Bob's behavior on the website. For example, information about his location, devices used, what content he usually checks and more. We will see why is it a problem soon.
show slide (Bob and surveillance trackers)
And it's not only News.com who's getting and storing personal data about Bob. Governments, internet service providers and hackers can also tap into the communication between Bob and News.com. As a matter of fact, they can tap into the communication between Bob and any other website and app.
show slide (Data harvested from Bob)
Only by visiting websites and using apps, Bob keeps leaking his personal data and behaviour patterns to multiple entities. All his data can be used to put together an incredibly accurate profile of Bob, which can be used to understand his habits, to influence his decisions, to discriminate him and his family and for censorship purposes.
show slide (Bob and Tor)
One day, Bob watched a TEDx talk about the dark web and the Tor network. He became more aware of how he was being exposed to the danger of personal data leaks and he decided to start using Tor. For that, he installed the Tor browser and, as usual, visited his favorite news.com website.
show slide (Bob news.com and Tor)
But this time, news.com doesn't really know that Bob visited the website, because the Tor network shuffles his connection within many different computers in the network. This makes it impossible for the news.com website to track and collect Bob's data.
show slide  (Bob news.com and surveillance trackers)
Government and hackers also get confused because for them it seems like Bob always visiting the same website. Bob is now connecting to websites and apps from within the Tor network, which hides all Bob's activity. This makes it impossible for anyone to understand what Bob is up to.
The basic idea is that the all connections will go through the Tor network, which will shuffle them. So it becomes almost impossible to track what Tor users do online.
{pause}

Bob only had to install and use the Tor browser to protect his privacy online. The browser lets Bob to access the normal internet. And he won’t just stumble upon criminal websites as long as he doesn't put a lot of effort finding them, since those websites are not even listed on Google.
Now that we understand how Tor network works, why should we use it?
The basic idea is that our personal data matters and in the wrong hands, it can be harmful to us and our society.
show slide (cambridge analytica)
As we've been made aware recently, our personal data can change the course of democratic elections. Just think about the case of how Cambridge Analytica used data of millions of people to influence the US elections, with the help of Facebook. 
As individuals, by protecting our private data we are effectively protecting our freedom of speech and right for privacy. Collectively, protecting our data has a powerful effect that can be a game changer. It's all about economics: if we make it really hard and expensive for corporations and governments to harvest our online data, the whole business model based on our personal and private data becomes nonviable. In such a world, the society takes a huge step forward towards a less discriminatory society where everyone's privacy is protected.
show slide (turkey bylock)
Not only corporations are using our online private data without our consent. Recently, the Turkish government put to prison thousands of innocent people based on the fact they visited a messaging website. Thousands of people lost lost their jobs and were marginalized in their communities because they visited an open website. The interesting thing is that many of these people didn't even know they had visited the website. This can happen because we are all leaking too much information about what we do online.
show slide (kill people based on meta)
Or take the word of a former director of the US National Security Agency saying publicly that the US government is killing people based on private data gathered online, without people even knowing that data about themselves is being collected and analysed in a systematic way.
As Edward Snowden once said, "Without Tor, the streets of the internet become like the streets of a very heavily surveilled city. [...] With Tor, we have private spaces and private lives." Basically, Tor and dark web technologies have the power to put us back in control about what personal information do we want to disclose and to whom.
<maybe talk about bypassing censorship?>
A good starting point to protect our privacy is to use the Tor browser to access the internet. If you want to learn more, check the Security Planner guide by The Citizen Lab from the University of Toronto. There you can find how to install Tor on your laptop and mobile phone. And because Tor does not solve all online privacy and security problems, you can also find much more about how to effectively protect your personal data.

I hope you are more concerned about the immense possibilities for our personal data to be exploited and used against you and our society. That is a good thing, because from fear comes action! 
Now that we all know how to better protect our sensitive and personal data online, let's take a step forward and leverage the technologies that enable the dark web in our own benefit. And let's remember that any technology is just a tool! Instead of being afraid of its misuse, it's up to us to use them in a way that takes society forward in terms of freedom, privacy and security.
Thank you!

To be honest, I'd really like to see many more hands raised! I know this sounds weird.. Many people know the dark web as the place for criminals to do their businesses online.
That is true, but the fact is that not only the child pornography industry or drug dealers who use the dark web. People concerned with their personal privacy are also using dark web technology to protect their privacy.

Tor was originally created by the US military with the primary purpose of protecting government communications. But with the time, it became much more than that. Nowadays, it is an open source project used by millions of people.
I use the dark web on a daily basis. And I do it because I know what it means not to use it. When any of us visit a website, there is a lot of data about ourselves and our behavior that is leaked and collected by different people, even without our consent or knowledge.
I read a lot of news online. Let's see what happens when I visit news.com website to check the latest news.
show slide (visit news.com)
News.com will be able to understand where from I am accessing the website. It will know from which device, configurations and which content I visit often. All this data is collected, stored and eventually correlated with data from my previous visits or even with data other websites have gathered from me and sold to news.com. 
show slide (data gathered from me)
Eventually, news.com is able to build an incredibly accurate profile about me and my behavior online, while I have no idea that my data is being collected nor how it can be used. 
And it is not only news.com or other websites which are interested on my personal data.
show slide (threat actors)
Internet service providers, criminals and even nation states also have the capabilities and the willingness to analyse my traffic online: which websites I visit, what content I read, where, from and when are just some examples.
So here I am, using the internet as everyone else and leaking massive amounts of data about myself to corporations, governments and potentially criminals. This data can be used to influence my decisions, to discriminate me my family, for commercial and even censorship purposes.
The dark web - and particularly Tor - can protect us from threat actors who try to analyse my online traffic.
show slide (Tor and threat actors confused)
The basic idea about the Tor network is that it maintains a network of computers that shuffle and encrypts our connections to websites and apps. This way, the threat actors cannot understand what I'm up to online. Through Tor, I'm in control of what data I want to disclose about me online.
I decided to use dark web technologies everyday because I believe that my personal and private life matters. I'm also aware that our data in the wrong hands can be harmful for us as individuals and for our society.
show slide (cambridge analytica)
We recently learned that our personal data can change the course of democratic elections. Just think about the case of how Cambridge Analytica used data of millions of people to influence the US elections. 
As individuals, by protecting our private data we are effectively protecting our freedom of speech and right for privacy. Collectively, protecting our data has a powerful effect that can be a game changer.

show slide (turkey bylock)
Not only corporations are gathering and using our online private data without our consent. Recently, the Turkish government put to prison thousands of innocent people based on the fact they visited a messaging website. These people lost their jobs and were marginalized in their communities. The interesting thing is that many of these people didn't even know they had visited the website and that it was an website used by the organizers of the failed coupe in Turkey in 2016. This situation happen because we are all leaking too much information about what we do online.
Western states are capable and willing to put its citizens under massive surveillance too. Remember about the leaked documents by former CIA and NSA employees showing the online surveillance programs that US and western european countries have ongoing. As we speak, those programs are collecting, storing and analysing in a systematic way or behavior online on a really precise and individual level. And what do nation states do with that data?
show slide (kill people based on meta)
Well, the former director of the US National Security Agency once said publicly that the US government is killing people based on private data gathered online, for example. 
As Edward Snowden former NSA employee and one of the people who let the world know about the mass surveillance programs carried by nation states once said that "Without Tor, the streets of the internet become like the streets of a very heavily surveilled city. [...] With Tor, we have private spaces and private lives." 
Basically, Tor and dark web technologies have the power to put us back in control about what personal information do we want to disclose and to whom.
The dark web technologies are protecting human rights all over the world. Millions of people have their access to websites, such as Wikipedia, blocked by their governments. Tor helps circumventing the censorship mechanisms. The dark web technologies are also protecting citizens at risk: Journalists working on critical cases, political dissidents and people encouraging social change and political reforms may have their lives dependent on remaining anonymous online.

If you want to join me and millions of other people as a dark web user, a good starting point to protect your online privacy is to install and use the Tor browser to access the internet. The Tor browser comes with all the configurations to route the traffic through the Tor network out of the box. It's as simple as that!   
If you want to learn more check, for example, the Security Planner guide by The Citizen Lab from the University of Toronto. There you can find how to install Tor on your computer and mobile phone. And because Tor does not solve all online privacy and security problems, you can also find much more about how to effectively protect your personal data.

I hope you are concerned about the immense possibilities for our personal data to be exploited and used against you and our society. I believe that is a good thing, because from fear comes action! Let's use and leverage the technologies that enable the dark web in our own benefit. And remember that any technology is just a tool! Instead of being afraid of its misuse, it's up to us to use them in a way that takes society forward in terms of freedom, privacy and security.
Thank you!
