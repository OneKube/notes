### The internet makes us vulnerable

This is the BylockApp. This mobile app has a really interesting story behind it. BylockApp was a messaging app developed and used by the organizers of the Turkish failed state coup of 2016. They used this app to communicate within the group to organize and carry out the state coup.

Right after the coup failed, the Turkish court ruled that using the BylockApp was enough evidence to link the user to the group. Under this law, the government charged and put to prison thousands of people accused of treason.
But many of those accused of using the BylockApp were confused and claimed innocence. They said they had never heard about the app, never used it and had nothing to do with the coup group.

Mr Tuncay, a software security forensics expert, got interested in this case. He found out that thousands of Turkish citizens cellphones were infected by a malicious software that behaved like BylockApp, making connections to the bylock server, even though the app itself was not installed. This software was developed and spread by the coup organizers as a trick to confuse the government. 

This was a really smart move by the coup organizers: after this incident was found, the government could not use the bylock app as an evidence against them anymore, because now thousands of innocents where "seen" using BylockApp by the government.

Let's think about this case for a while: 11 thousand innocent people were prosecuted and put to prison because their phones were hacked by malicious software developed by the coup organizers. At the same time, their government was spying on what they were doing online.
The ByLock case shows that the internet is making us all vulnerable. Its complexity and lack of mechanisms to ensure our privacy online leaves us, citizens, powerless and in the hands of criminals, corporations and governments. 


When using the internet, we leak information about ourselves and our behaviour in every actions we do. Data about  â€œwho am I talking to and which online content I am accessing to? from and to where?; from which physical locations; and which devices I use. This data is being collected at a massive scale by government, corporations and potentially criminals. 

It is not a matter of whether you or your family explicitly share this information on social media. This happens regardless of whether you give consent or not. In the current internet, there is no mechanism in place to protect us from these vulnerabilities. 

And what this means in practice has a profound impact on our society: think about how Cambridge Analytica has influenced the last presidential elections in the US, based on data collected from millions of Americans, without them knowing about it.

That's what the internet is turning into - a place for those who have political and economical power to collect and use our data to maintain and gain more power. And we are contributing to all this, whether we want or not.

You might think that you have nothing to hide. You don't care whether our data is being collected and used by governments or big corporations. But I'm afraid that's not the only problem.

Think that personal privacy is the basis for an internet in which free access to information and freedom of speech are respected. Governments in Syria, China, Turkey, are blocking access to political, ideological and religious content online because they can see what we are doing online. 
Governments are silencing political activists, whistleblowers and journalists because they are able to track what they do online.

With the current internet, we cannot ensure that our personal privacy, free access to information and freedom of speech are respected. I do believe that online privacy is the foundation for a free and fair internet, which is becoming interchangeable with a free and fair society. I'm passionate about building a better and safer internet, so today I'm here to tell how we can fix this problem. 

But let me be upfront with you: The solution I'm going to propose is controversial. Based on research, 7 out of 10 people believe it should not exist. The media usually portraits it as "the dark corners of the internet" and "disturbing technology".

But for big problems, we need bold solutions: I believe that one of the solutions for the current state of the internet is the dark web. I'm telling you this as a person who not only uses the dark web on a daily basis but also actively contributes for it to keep running.

If you heard about the dark web before, you might be skeptical about this idea. If the dark web is completely new to you, I'm sure you can't help but think that even the name is somewhat scary. But before we jump to conclusions - let's see what the dark web is. 

A dark web is a network of computers within the normal internet in which you need special software and configuration to access it. You can access the normal websites and apps through it and also services which are only available with its software.

Under this definition, there are multiple dark webs in use nowadays. However the most popular dark web is created by the Tor software. Tor - standing for The Onion Router - is the network that provides a strong layer of anonymity to anyone who's using it. Tor was originally created by the US military with the primary purpose of protecting government communications. But with the time, it became much more than that: nowadays, it is an open source project used by millions of people trying to protect their privacy online.
But how does the dark web solve the privacy vulnerabilities of the internet?

Let's imagine the internet like a set Tennis matches. Whenever you want to visit a website or app, you start a match. Users and websites exchange messages - the balls - with each other.  While the match goes on, the audience - threat actors such as governments, corporations and criminals - are watching who is exchanging balls, at what time, for how long and so on and recording everything in their log books.

The Tor network works like a Tennis thrower machine. This thrower machine collects balls from many players and throws them to the correct destination. Now, instead of exchanging balls directly with the websites and services, the users communicate through the ball thrower. What this means in practice is that the audience cannot trace back who is playing with whom. In practice, this means you can access twitter, google, bylockapp or any other website and all the thread actors can see is that you are using a tennis thrower machine. In reality, the Tor network is a set computers that receives requests, shuffles and encrypts them and forwards them to the correct destinations.

As an user, all you need to do is to install the Tor browser and visit the websites through it. Many people are afraid of stumbling upon criminal websites when accessing the internet through the dark web. We we saw from this example, you are in control of what you do and what websites you visit.

The Tor dark web is often accused of letting the child pronography industry, drug dealers and other criminals to do their businesses online. It is true that the anonymity provided by Tor are an important asset for criminals. But that's a shortsighted way of looking at technology: Cash money can also be used anonymously to fund terrorism. However, it was one of the most transformative technologies ever invented by humans. Think of the dark web as just a tool: it's up to us to decide how to use it.

And many people are using it the right way. As a matter of fact, research as shown that the bulk of the traffic going through Tor is for legit websites that you and me would not feel uncomfortable visiting. 

Only with dark web technologies like Tor we can ensure that our personal privacy, free access to information and freedom of speech are respected online.


Instead of being afraid of it's misuse, let's embrace the dark web and use it to empower us and our society. To help us all protect our private lives, as well as ensuring that we keep our freedom of access to information and freedom of speech online. Join me on supporting and using the dark web to make the internet a better place: a place that takes society forward in terms of freedom, privacy and security.
