The internet can be a dangerous place

ByLock case

<show slide coup> On 15th of July of 2016 close to midnight, military flight jets were witnessed flying over Ankara, Turkey, It was the beginning of a 2 day coup attempt to remove Erdogan and his government from power. The coup failed, and on those 2 days alone more than 260 people died; This event was followed by a crack down on the people the government believed were behind the failed coup. 
As part of measures to bring the organizers of the failed coup to justice, the Turkish court ruled that using a messaging app called ByLock was enough evidence to link the user to the group. Under this argument, the government charged and put to prison thousands of people accused of treason.
<show slide bylock app> ByLock was a messaging app just like WhatsApp and Telegram which was allegedly used by the organizers of the coup. But thousands of those who were accused of using the app, where shocked with the accusations and pledged innocence: many of them had never heard about the app before and had no affiliation whatsoever with the group.
<show slide news bylock> A computer security forensics expert have found that about 11 thousand people charged on the ByLock case were innocent. What had happened was that other apps installed in their phones were redirecting them to the ByLock server, without people's knowledge. This was discovered as being a diversion maneuver set up by the group who organized the coup so thal;p0ot the government could not use the usage of ByLock as evidence.
So 11 thousand innocent people were put to prison because their phones were hacked by the coup group, while their government was spying on what they were doing online.
<show slide the internet is dangerous>The ByLock case shows that the internet is a dangerous place. Its complexity and lack of mechanisms to ensure our privacy online leaves us, citizens, powerless and in the hands of criminals, corporations and governments. 
the internet is dangerous

<show slide type of data> When using the internet, we leak information about ourselves and our behaviour in every actions we do. Data about  â€œwho am I talking to and which online content I am accessing to? from and to where?; from which physical locations; and which devices I use. This data is being collected at a massive scale by government, corporations and potentially criminals. 

It is not a matter of whether you or your family explicitly share this information on social media. This happens regardless of whether you give consent or not. In the current internet, there is no mechanism in place to protect us from these vulnerabilities. And what this means in practice has a profound impact on our society: think about how Cambridge Analytica has influenced the US elections based on data collected from millions of Americans. That's what the internet is turning into - a place for those who have political and economical power to collect and use our data to maintain and gain power. And we are feeding all this, whether we want or not.


solution - dark web

<show slide solution> I believe that online privacy is the foundation for a free and fair internet, which is becoming interchangeable with a free and fair society. I'm passionate about building a better and safer internet, so today I'm here to tell how we can fix this problem. 

But let me be upfront with you: The solution I'm going to propose is controversial. Based on research, 7 out of 10 people believe it should not exist. The media usually portraits it as "the dark corners of the internet" and "disturbing technology".

But for big problems, we need bold solutions: I believe that one of the solutions for the current state of the internet is the dark web. <show slide solution darkweb>  I'm telling you this as a person who not only uses the dark web on a daily basis but also actively contributes for it to keep running.

what is the dark web 

If you heard about the dark web before, you might be skeptical about this idea. If the dark web is completely new to you, I'm sure you can't help but think that even the name is somewhat scared. But before we jump to conclusions - let's see what the dark web is. 

<show slide internet-darkweb> The dark web is a network within the normal internet which adds all the privacy features that are missing by default. To access the dark web, you need specific software. This software allows you to visit the normal internet and websites which can only be accessed through dark web software.
Under this definition, there are multiple dark webs nowadays, however the most popular dark web is created by the Tor software<show slide Tor>. Tor - standing for The Onion Router - is the network that provides a strong layer of anonymity to anyone who's using it. Tor was originally created by the US military with the primary purpose of protecting government communications. But with the time, it became much more than that: nowadays, it is an open source project used by millions of people trying to protect their privacy online.
But how does the dark web solve the privacy vulnerabilities of the internet?

Let's imagine the internet like a Tennis match  <show slide internet Tennis>. Users and websites exchange messages - the balls - with each other.  While the match goes on, the audience - threat actors such as governments, corporations and criminals - are watching who is exchanging balls, at what time, for how long and so on and recording everything in their log books.

<show slide ball thrower>The Tor network works like a Tennis thrower machine. We install a browser that forwards our connections to the thrower machine. At the same time, thousands of other people are doing the same: using the Tor browser and sending their balls to the same machine bucket. The machine then shuffles all the balls and delivers them to the right player - the websites and users to which the balls should be sent to. The threat actors who are watching the matches will be confused and lose track about who are exchanging balls and cannot fill their log book based on what they see. The Tennis thrower machine does a good job at masking where our connections are going to - basically our behaviour online. Just by installing and using the Tor browser, we can access Google, twitter, the bylock app or Wikipedia and all information we are giving out is that we are using the Tennis thrower machine, just like many other people.

As an user, all you need to do is to install the Tor browser and access visit the websites through it. Many people are afraid of stumbling upon criminal websites when accessing the internet through the dark web. We we saw from this example, you are in control of what you do and what websites you visit.

what we gain with the dark web

<show dark web crime slide>  The dark web is often accused of letting the child pronography industry, drug dealers and other criminals to do their businesses online. It is true that the anonymity provided by the dark web technologies are an important asset for criminals. But that's a shortsighted way of looking at technology: <show cash analogy slide> Cash money can also be used anonymously to fund terrorism. However, it was one of the most transformative technologies ever invented by humans. Think of the dark web as just a tool: it's up to us to decide how to use it. And many people are using it the right way. As a matter of fact, research as shown that the bulk of the traffic going through Tor is for legit websites that you and me would not feel uncomfortable visiting.

<show slide data collection/mass surveillance > With dark web technologies like Tor, we can protect our private data from corporations, criminals and governments who are willing to use it to discriminate and influence us. The dark web protects our personal privacy.

<show slide censorship > With dark web technologies like Tor, people can bypass censorship imposed by governments. In Syria, Turkey, China and many other countries, people cannot visit Wikipedia or access to specific political and ideological content online is blocked. The dark web protects our freedom of access to information.

<show slide journalists, political activists > With dark web technologies like Tor, we can protect journalists, whistleblowers and political activist. People like Edward Snowden who revealed the surveillance programs conducted by the US government and anonymous bloggers in oppressive regimes need to be protected. The dark web protects our freedom of speech.


how can we use the dark web?

<show slide security planner> And how about you? If you think that your private life matters, I challenge you to go ahead, download the Tor browser and start using it! The Security Planner guide by the University of Toronto will get you started at this, so go ahead and take a look at it.

wrap up

<show Edward Snowden slide> As Edward Snowden said that the "Without Tor, the streets of the internet become like the streets of a very heavily surveilled city. [...] With Tor, we have private spaces and private lives."

Instead of thinking of the dark web as the internet for criminals, let's think of it as a way to protect our private lives online. The normal internet is what we should be concerned with: controlled by big corporations and governments it is ripe for mass surveillance, collecting private data for business purposes and prone to censorship. 
Join me by using dark web to make the internet a better place: a place that takes society forward in terms of freedom, privacy and security. <show cat slide gif>
Thank you!
