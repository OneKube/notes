## Intro

```
The main goal of the talk is to raise awareness about the importance for common
internet users to protect their data and footprints online (e.g. metadata), in 
order to protect their privacy and freedom online. The twist is that the same
technologies that can protect our privacy and citizens at risk (political and
digital dissidents, citizens at risk), is also powering the so called dark web.
Thus, complementary goals are to 1) highlight that technology can be used for 
the good or bad, but that does not make it inherently good or bad, 2) protecting
 personal data and privacy means protecting everyone's rights and freedom and 
3) it is easy to start using the technologies and contribute.

What does the child pronography industry and oppositors of oppressive regimes or 
citizens concerned with personal privacy have in common? They are all using the 
same technology to access the internet anonymously. The same technology that 
allows criminals to buy and sell drugs online is also powering social 
progressive agendas and protecting citizens' private life.

The technologies that enable criminals to operate and which power the so called
dark web, are the same technologies that have the potential to protect citizens
from rogue states, data harvesting from corporations, protect privacy and free
speech and, ultimately, freedom.

## Goals of the talk

Most of the times, when I tell friends and non so technical people that they
should be accessing the web through technologies that are used to access the 
dark web for protecting their privacy, I am received with reactions of fear, 
confusion and even disgust.

Oneof their main concern is if whether using those technologies is illegal. 
Or even more important, if they will stumble upon drug ads and child pronography
material right away. The quick answer is no and no. We will soon dive deeper
into those questions and much more. It has never been easy to talk about this 
subject because of the misinformation about the darkweb and its technologies and
the difference between them. Today, we will try to go through those questions.

To tackle this subject, we'll try to answer three basic questions: what, why and 
how? what is the dark web and its technologies, why should you use them, how can
 you use them?

## What is the darkweb
Let's start with the first question: what is the dark web and the technologies
that power them?

A dark web is an internet that can be accessed only with specific software and 
configurations. The specific software and configurations hide the footprints of 
users and webpages. Basically, it allows users to access the internet
anonymous as it becomes really hard to track what webpages and apps they've been
visiting. This is the reason why those technologies are compeeling to criminals,
as well as people concerned with their privacy online.

The dark web users and services rely on a set of technologies that allow users 
to be anonymous and untraceable. An example of a dark web is the privacy 
protecting network formed by Tor users and services. Tor - standing for The 
Onion Router - is one of the main technologies enabling anonymous communication 
between users and services. 

From a practical perspective, - from your perspective - you just need to replace
your web browser (say, internet explorer/chrome/safari) by a browser that routes
the web traffic through the Tor network. That's it. You then go ahead and browse through the same 
websites than before and keep using the internet as always. This time though, you are 
assured that no one can track your behaviour online without your consent. 
There are other ways to route the traffic through the Tor network so that not
only your sites activity is protected, but also which apps you are using and
which devices at your home are connected to the internet. At the end of the talk,
I will give you more hints about how to get that done too!

To understand how can Tor protect our data - as well as being used for the dark
web - let's briefly take a look on how it works.

But first, please take a few moments to breath and bear with me through the next
more technical 5 minutes. Technical details are complicated and not always 
black and white and even the experts and maintainers of these technologies 
recognise the complexity of these. Let's really briwfly try to understand how
Tor works.

>> Tor brief tech explanation

## Why should you use Tor? Why is it so important?
Tor can protect you from traffic analysis. Traffic analysis consists of tracking
your online bahaviour based on the websites and services you use, and from 
which location. With this information, websites are able to discriminate you, 
corporations may acquire information about you and your family that you may not 
feel confortable with and governaments may

Tor can protect your metadata. Metadata consists of ... 
At first, metadata harvesting might not seem dangerous but ...
As Michael Hayden, former NSA-Director once said, "We kill People based on Metadata"

Thus to this characteristics, Tor is effective against internet censorship, in
which users can access destination and content which would be restricted by
governaments or ISPs.

Journalists, whiteleblowers, political dissidents, NGOs, use Tor to communicate
and share information safely, without being traced by potential rogue
governaments or enemies.

Tor does not solve all the problems. It only protects the transport of data.

Why is data harvesting important?

As our lives become more connected than even, corporations and malintented
organizations have the capabilities to harvest more and more data about our
private data. Where do we usually access the internet? Which websites do we use 
the most? What are our interests? Which services do we use? All this data can be
easily harvested and ultimately put together to make a realisitc map of who we
are. This data can easily be used for business purposes, discrimination and or
criminal purposes.

It's easier than ever for personal information to be collected and exploited by 
ad companies and other corporations. Almost half of all websites roughly 99% of 
popular news sites have tracking software installed on their 
webpages [1][2]. These trackers can reveal your identity, health and income
data, or where you live. 

End-to-end encription is equaly important. Unfortunately, we cannot rely on
current websites and apps to do that for us.

Another important point for using these technologies is to make ilicit data
harvesting so harder that it becomes inviable. It's all about economics: if hackers and
big companies cannot harvest illegally people's data because it is protected,
then it becomes just too expensive for them to do so. It becomes too expensive
for companies like Cambridge Analytica to profile people's based on their data
in order to change the course of democraric elections. Or it becomes realy
expensive for rogue governaments to spy on their citizens looking for
opportunities to silent regime or moral oppositors. Same goes for hackers who 
are selling your data to god knows who.
If enough people turn on their privacy shields on, then all those business
models will not make sense and our society gives a step forward!
So it becomes almost an ethically and moral imperative to protect your personal data. 
Not only for yourself, but for a fairer and more secure online society.

And how can you do it? With the help of technologies that -- unfortunately --
also power the dark web.


## How can you benefit from those technologies (concrete steps on how to use 
## the technologies that power the dark web for yours and society benefit)

So at this point you are asking yourself: what practical steps can I take in
order to start protecting myself, my family and use these great technologies?

A very good guide by The Citizen Lab from the University of Toronto called
Security Planner (https://securityplanner.org/) <show in slides>. There you can
find really good guides and easy guides to help youi protect your data and setup
the Tor browsers in your desktop and Android or Apple device.

## Wrap up

The technologies that power the dark web are exactly that: technologies. 
Instead of being afraid of their misuse, it's up to us to use them in a way that
takes society forward in terms of freedom, privacy and security.

### Notes

Without Tor, the streets of the internet become like the streets of a very
heavily surveilled city. [...] With Tor, we have private spaces and private 
lives. â€”Edward Snowden 

- fear of retribution (whitleblowers, activits, journalists)
- censorship (organizational/national level)
- privacy
- tracking and data mining
- irresponble and vulnerable devices
- state and corporation surveilance
- anonymous
- anti-tracking 
- trackers can reveal identity, health, income, economical and personal
  situation information (e.g. pregnant, with children, etc..) and which places
	do you visit the most, where's your home
- mass surveilance
- the importance of metadata "Michael Hayden (NSA-Director): "We kill People based on Metadata""


- technologies that power the dark web BUT you should use:
	- Tor
	- VPN
	- bitcoin

- others important
	- DuckDuckGo

- some mistakes from my short talk:
	- darkweb is not good though
	- technology is good
