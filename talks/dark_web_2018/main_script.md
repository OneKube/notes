The main goal of the talk is to raise awareness about the importance for common internet users to protect their data and footprints online (e.g. metadata), in order to protect their privacy and freedom online. The twist is that the same
technologies that can protect our privacy and citizens at risk (political and digital dissidents, citizens at risk), is also powering the so called dark web. Thus, complementary goals are to 1) highlight that technology can be used for 
the good or bad, but that does not make it inherently good or bad, 2) protecting personal data and privacy means protecting everyone's rights and freedom and 3) thast it is easy to start using the technologies and contribute.

## Script

Good evening! Let me ask you how many of you here have accessed 
the dark web before? Oh, I see one, two, me. Not that many.. To be honest, I'd 
love to see many more hands raised! I know, it sounds weird, right? Isn't the
dark web the place where criminals do their businesses online!? But do you know 
what do oppositors of oppressive regimes, people concerned with their personal 
privacy and for example, the child pornography industry have in common? They are
all using the same technology to access the internet anonymously. Exactly, the
same technologies that are used by criminals to buy and sell drugs online are also 
empowering social progressive agendas and protect citizens' private life.

It's easy to understand why between fear and skepticism, we usually miss the 
point that the same technology that allows the so called dark web to thrive, 
can also help us to
protect our data from bad actors and corporations. I know that the dark web is a
scary topic. However, there is a lot of misinformation and preconception about 
the dark web and its technologies. At this point you are probably thinking 
... **joke** ...

I'm pretty sure that you are imagining the dark web as a sketchy place. And you 
are right! There are online drug stores aplenty and anyone can easily find 
stolen credit card on sale, for example. However, I'm not an 
advocate of the illegal businesses going on the dark web. I'm here show how we
all can use dark web technology to protect ourselves. I want to show you
that at the end of the day, the technology is just a tool. It can be used for 
good or bad, and it's up to us decide how to use it.

I'm pretty sure that at this point, you are really skeptical about all of this.
So today I'd like to address the skepticism around this subject. We will discuss
the difference between the dark web and the technologies that enable it. And why
you should even considering using them. Hopefully towards the end you will agree
with me that using dark web technologies on a daily basis can be beneficial for
you and our society, so I will quickly give you some tips on how to get you
plugged in.

###  What is the darkweb

But let's start with the first question: what is the dark web and what 
technologies make it possible and why, exactly?

You can see the dark web just like the internet that we are used to. However, it
can be accessed only with specific software and configurations which allows you
to become practically anonymous when using the internet. Moreover, it also
allows you access to websites - the called hidden services - that are not listed
in the usual search engines, like Google.

Under this definition, there are multiple dark webs in use nowadays.
However the most popular dark web is enabled by the Tor	software. Tor - standing
for The Onion Router - is a software that provides its users a strong layer of 
anonymity by hiding all data from its users and websites. 

Basically, accessing the internet through Tor is not different from what we are
all used to. The easiest way to access it is to install a pre-configured browser
and that's pretty much it. So let's see how the Tor software works.

But first, meet Bob.

**show slide**

Bob is just like anyone of us. He's been using the internet for a long time and 
part of his morning routine is to drink a coffee while reading the news at 
www.news.com website.

**show slide**

News.com Co. is using a bunch of trackers that get a lot of information about
Bob's behavior on the website. Information about his location, devices in which
he accesses the webpage, what content he usually checks, etc. All this data can
be used to put together an incredible accurate profile of Bob, his political 
affiliations, ideology, family status, etc.. Although everyone trust New.com 
Co., no one is really sure if the company will eventually be acquired by some
one less trustworthy, or if the company may be hacked and all Bob's information
will be sold to criminals. Anyways, Bob might not even be aware that News.com
has all this information about himself.

**show slide**

Not only News.com can get personal and sensitive data about Bob. The government
and other actors can also tap into the communication between Bob and New.com. As
a matter of fact, they can tap into the communication between Bob and any other
website and app. 

**show slide**

Basically, only by visiting the websites and using apps, Bob is leaking his 
personal data and being tracked by many different entities. Those entities
create and store an accurate profile of Bob without him knowing about it. Really
concrete examples of what data we are talking about are

**show slide**

This might be too much information to that Tom would like to reveal to anyone, 
let alone to companies that may sell and use the data without Tom's consent, or
used for example, discriminate Tom based on his interests.

**show slide**

One day, Bob watched a TEDx talk about the dark web and the Tor network. He got
more aware of how he was being exposed nowadays to personal data leaks and he
decided to start using Tor. For that, he installed the Tor browser and, as
usual, visited his favorite news.com website.

**show slide**

But this time, news.com doesn't really know that the request comes from Bob,
because the Tor network shuffles his request within many different computers in
the network. This makes it impossible for the news.com website to track and
collect Bob's data/

**show slide**

Others also got confused because they see that Bob is only sending requests to
one address. For all the websites Bob visits, he's sending his request through
the Tor network. This makes it impossible for governments and bad actors to
understand what is Bob up to. 

**show slide**

The basic idea is that the all connections will go through the Tor 
network, which will shuffle them. So it becomes almost impossible to understand 
who is accessing what, making it hard for websites and bad actors to track users
and discriminate them based on their profile or use that information in harmful 
ways.

With this simple example, it's clear that all we need to start protecting our 
personal data is to install and use a special browser. It's also clear that
being connected to the internet with Tor allows you to visit normal websites you 
are used to, instead of any sketchy dark web and criminal website. Many of those
criminal websites are not even listed on the normal search engines such as
google. So you won't just stumble upon them any ways.

It is easy to understand why the Tor network is the preferred way for criminals
to operate. But then again, technologies are not intrinsically good of bad, it
all depends on how it is used. And researches have shown that the big bulk of
the traffic that goes through the Tor network is connecting to legit
non-criminal websites. So, not only Tor can protect your online data, it's
already doing it for many people!

## Why should you use Tor?

Our lives are more connected than ever. From the cellphone which we carry
everywhere with us, to home devices such as toaster and the fridge for example,
we are constantly online. These devices end up sending and leaking data about 
our behaviors to 3rd parties.

As we saw earlier in this talk, the evil comes from data correlation. Over time,
it becomes fairly easy to trace an accurate profile of individuals which allow
governments, corporations and hackers to essentially spy on us and use our data
for business purposes, to censor people and ideas, for discrimination and to help
targeted attacks against people.

It is really hard to have a clear picture of what type of data is being
disclosed and to whom. One thing is certain though: we are leaking a lot of data
about us and our behavior. One of the main
reasons to use dark web technologies is to protect us from unintentionally share
private data about ourselves and our families while using the internet.

As individuals, by protecting our private data we are effectively protecting our
freedom of speech and right for privacy. Collectively, protecting our data has a 
powerful effect that can be a game changer. It's all about economics: if we make
it really hard and expensive for corporations and governments to harvest our 
online data, the
whole business model based on our personal and private data becomes nonviable. 
In such a world, the society takes a huge step forward towards a less
discriminatory society where everyone's privacy is protected.

Technologies like Tor create a privacy layer which allows you to protect your
online privacy and avoid sensitive data leaks. These technologies also help
people to circumvent state censorship and help people to remain anonymous while 
fighting for their rights - either as a journalist reporting on human right
violations or as a political dissident fighting for a fairer society.

**show slide**
As Edward Snowden once said, "Without Tor, the streets of the internet become 
like the streets of a very heavily surveilled city. [...] With Tor, we have 
private spaces and private lives."

Basically, these technologies have the power to put us back in control about
what personal information do we want to disclose and to whom.

### How can you benefit from those technologies

At this point you are asking yourself how can I join Bob and use Tor for my own
benefit? 

<slide>
A very good starting point is the Security Planner guide by The Citizen Lab 
from the University of Toronto. There you can find really easy explanations on
how to install Tor on your laptop and mobile phone. And because Tor does not 
solve all online privacy and security problems, you can also find much more 
information about encrypting your connections, safe password management, etc.

Using these technologies is usually quite straightforward. The hard part is
usually to change our bad habits.

### Wrap up

By now, I truly hope you more afraid than 15m ago of the interconnected world we
live in
and the immense possibilities for our personal data to be exploited and used
against us and our society. That is a good thing, since from fear comes action!
Now that we all know how to better protect our sensitive and personal data
online, let's take a step forward and leverage the technologies that enable the 
dark web, in our own benefit. And let's remember that any 
technology is just a tool! Instead of being afraid of its misuse, it's up 
to us to use them in a way that takes society forward in terms of freedom, 
privacy and security.

Thank you!

- I don't have any real case scenario about how data tracking by websites and
  governments/hackers can be really bad. Add it?

## Snail mail analogy

Meet Tom! He's from a somewhat parallel universe where snail mail is still the
main communication medium between people, newspapers and discussion forums.

He sends snail mail to different people and forums every day, asking questions and
commenting about things such as current affairs, political news and health 
related questions.

The postal clerk keeps a log of the Tom's address and to where he sends the mail.
Since the mail has to go through several postal workers and postal offices
until it reaches its destinations, Tom's correspondence is logged in many places.

The postal clerk is somewhat careless too. They don't care if other people snoop
on Tom's envelopes!! These people may be interested to know to where is Tom
sending mails and they also keep a log of it.

The receivers of Tom's correspondence also keep log of all Tom's letters. But 
the receivers have also access to the mail's content, not only where it comes
from!

The receivers start to find patterns on Tom's mail content: he likes to comment
about homosexual rights and he's often concerned about the current political
government and its totalitarian inclinations. 

Tom does not particularly trust the people and entities he sends the letters to.
He just wants to access information about these issues somewhere and to discuss
about them.

Eventually the postal clerk and the receivers of Tom's letters
start realizing the amount of data they gathered along the years of passing and
receiving letters from Tom. That data can now be used to trace a quite accurate
profile about Tom's behavior and personality.

All Tom wanted was to learn and discuss about the world and to answer his day to
day questions. As a byproduct of that, sensitive information about him and his
personal life is stored in many places, owned by people he doesn't even know.

And now the "govt. with totalitarian inclinations" has the means and the will to
Meet Tom! He's from a somewhat parallel universe where snail mail is still the


In our universe we have the internet. It works pretty much as Tom's snail mail
service and it suffers the same problems: many entities harvest and log data 
about our actions and behavior at different levels;

This data can be put together to profile us and used against us for
discrimination, commercial and persuasion purposes. No one benefits from it
aside those who are in power - political and commercial - and don't look at
means to maintain their positions.

What do we need? Awareness and action! One first easy step is to make sure the
snail mail - our online activity and content - is protected with a strong 
envelope.

Tom would like his personal data in his snail email he could wrap his original
envelope on another envelope that does not disclose the "From" address to
anyone. He would also try to shuffle his letters with other people before
sending it.

In out internet, the stronger envelope and shuffling can be achieved using Tor
and VPN. And by the way, it's quite easy to do it! Check, for example, the
Security Planner guide by Citizen Lab on how to be protected.

Tom's universe is not as far from our reality as we'd like. But  we have in our
hands a way to destroy the surveillance and business models that rely on our 
personal data.






## Old "WHY?"

Government have the tools and will to track and keep our online behavior. This
is dangerous because people have no more 

The first reason is that internet providers and governments have the tools and
the will to track online behavior of users and citizens
This is a fact and it was demonstrated by the documents leaked by Snowden and
Manning about internet surveillance programs carried out by the US and EU intelligent
services. You may trust your government and thus not be concerned about the
fact that your government is able to collect all your online activity - and of
your families. Remember though, that the data is not only collected but also
stored, and with the current volatility in our society, are we able to ensure
that sensitive data about ourselves and our families will not be used against us
in the future by some sketchy people that got to govern us? We do not need nor
have to take that risk.

--

Another reason is essentially that our lives are more connected than ever. The
danger of having more devices in our home connected to the internet is that it
opens doors to surveillance and targeted attacks. Unfortunately there have been
cases of attackers being able to speak to a baby through babycam which is
connected to the internet.
Apart from those targeted attacks, the fact that we are more connected than even
gives companies and malintented organizations the capabilities to
harvest more and more data about our private data. Where do we usually access
the internet? Which websites do we use the most? What are our interests? Which
services do we use? All this data can be easily harvested and ultimately put
together to make a accurate profile of who we are. This data can easily be used
for business purposes without our consent, discrimination and criminal purposes.

Technologies like Tor create a privacy layer which allows you to protect your
online privacy and sensitive data leaks.

--

The 3rd point I'd like to make is economics. Using these technologies is
basically making illicit data harvesting hard. So hard that it becomes nonviable
to do so. It's all about economics: if we all make it hard for attackers and
companies to illegally gather people's data, then it becomes just too
expensive for them to do so. It becomes too expensive for companies like
Cambridge Analytica to profile people's based on their data
in order to change the course of democratic elections. Or it becomes really
expensive for rogue governments to spy on their citizens looking for
opportunities to silent regime or moral oppositors. Same goes for hackers who
are selling your data to the highest bidder.
If enough people turn their privacy shields on, then all that business model
will just not work and our society gives a step forward!
So it becomes almost an ethically and moral imperative to protect your personal data.
Not only for yourself, but for a fairer and more secure online society.

--

Censorship circumvention 

If you are still not convinced and you still don't see a reason why you nor
anyone else should use technologies that hide user's online activity,
think about the journalists, whistle blowers, political dissidents, NGOs and
other citizens at risk that use Tor to communicate and share information safely,
without being traced by potential rogue governments or any malintended actors.
In those cases, it is life threatening to use the internet without the
privacy and security provided by Tor.
