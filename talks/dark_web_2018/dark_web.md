## The dark web, web surveilance and why you should care

Hi! My name is Goncalo and today I would like to tell you about The dark web, 
web surveillance and why you should care

The dark web, sometimes also called deep web is â€¦..SHORT DEFINITION

There is a common preconception about the dark web as the Oasis for criminals 
for buying and selling drugs, trafficking stolen identities and credit cards or 
for spreading child pornography. However not many are aware that is just a small
 fraction of the traffic that goes through the corners of the web.

It is easy to understand why the sensationalist media makes up or 
disproportionately highlights shaddy stories about the dark web. These are the 
kind of stories people want to hear and easily believe.

However,stories about political dissidents that are protected by the very same 
technology that powers the dark web are much less known to the public;

Stories about how people are using the dark web to circumvent the big Chinese 
firewall to access the open web or how people in Turkey who disagree with the 
current political party use the dark web to protect themselves and their 
families.

Or even how the same technology that powers the dark web can help all of us to 
protect our private data from corporations, hackers and even government - these
 stories remain unheard.

This talk will explain what the dark web is and debunk some myths about it. It 
will also show how the technology and tools that power the dark web can be used 
by the society at large for protecting our privacy in the connected world.
