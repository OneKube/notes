#### Title: Beautiful Go

#### Abstract:
Go is beautiful. It`s simplicity, concise syntax and well defined best practices
make it a pleasure for anyone to read write code, from new programmers to the
most experienced hacker. In this talk we embark on a voyage through examples of
beautiful code written in Go. We explore how the creators of Go approach
code comments and naming conventions when implementing Go`s primitives, how 
switches simplify Telegraf`s code design, how proper error handling will make it
a bliss to read code and enjoy the aesthetics of Go`s concurrency code.
All code examples are taken from outstanding open source projects written in Go,
including golang/go itself.

#### Audience:
Everyone. The talk is best suited for those who have basic programming
experience but not necessarily experienced in Go. However, experienced Go 
programmers will benefit from going through how best practices are implemented 
in the wild.

#### Estimated time: 25m + QA
