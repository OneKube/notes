## Everyone is naked: attacking the DHT

Distributed Hash Tables (DHT) are an important primitive which allow multiple 
nodes to collaboratively store and retrieve data in a completely decentralized
network. Nowadays, millions of users are using projects and service which rely 
on DHTs: Bittorrent, IPFS, Freenet, Ethereum are just examples of projects 
leveraging DHTs to store and retrieve data in decentralized networks. With the
upcoming Web 3.0, it is only expected that DHTs will become even more important
in future Internet applications.

The most popular DHT vanilla protocols leak information about which users are 
storing and retrieving what files, making it easy for adversaries to gather data
that can be correlated to understand what network users are up to. The data 
leaked can be used by adversaries for mass surveillance, censorship and 
privacy attacks on DHT users.

In this talk, we first dive into what are DHTs, how they work and how is user 
activity data leaked. After motivating the reasons of why anonymous and private
systems are important for the future the internet and society, we'll perform a 
live privacy attack on a public DHT. We will see how easy it is to harvest and 
correlate public activity in DHTs and generate usage profiles that can be used 
against DHT users.

We will also go through some techniques and protocols to harden privacy in DHTs 
based on current research and applications such as onion routing, 
friend-to-friend routing, and others.
