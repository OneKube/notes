## Decentralization and Privacy

My take on the paper "Systematizing Decentralization and Privacy: Lessons from 
15 Years of Research and Deployments"

(maybe twitter thread?)

by Carmela Troncoso, Marios Isaakidis, George Danezis, and Harry Halpin


---

### main ideas:

- "decentralization was originally a response to the threat of censorship"
- "although efficient and decentralized, DHTs do not themselves provide strong
  security, privacy and anonymity properties"
- importance of reputation and trust - not all the decentralization solutions
  rely on PoW and crypto, trustless primitives. (e.g. DHTs). Without reputation
together with incentives, peers in the network can easily perform attacks
- no authority in the network makes it important for protocol designers to
  carefully consider how to incentive nodes to ensure that adversaries or
selfish nodes do not damage the network
- privacy is only possible through decentralization 
- but few projects in the ecosystem take privacy and anonymity seriously enough
- some claim to do so, but weak threat models and assumptions hinder the
  security and privacy of the protocols
- advantage of decentralized systems in terms of security and privacy:
  - usually, attacker needs more resources to perturb the service (redundancy)
	- the only way to make private systems
	- aligned incentives between peers

// basically all the "3.3 How Does Decentralization Support Privacy?" section

- we are in the beginning of an era which has lots to improve.

- future research:


1. intro
	- based on the paper
	- kudos to authors
	- add my perspective and TL;DR

2. the first decentralization movement

3. the cloud took over

4. how about now? 
	- open problems, privacy, censorship, scalability, incentives

5. how to solve this? 
	- advanced cryptography (e.g. zero knowledge)
	- research and development focused on privacy and anonymity
	- oversimplified threat models

6. privacy-first movement

(and that's where hashmatter comes to the picture) ??
