abstract="What does it mean to be anonymous in network communications? Our central thesis is that both the theoretical literature and the deployed systems have gotten the answer essentially wrong. The answers have been wrong because they apply the wrong metric to the wrong adversary model. I indicate problems in the established adversary models and metrics for anonymity as well as implications for the design and analysis of anonymous communication systems.",
