## Eclipse and Re-Emergence of Anonymous P2P Storage Network Overlay Services
**Marios Isaakidis, George Danezis**

**what**
brief description of the key features of anonymous P2P storage networks and
showcase of overlay application currently in use (CENO). CENO is a distributed
censorship resistance service on top of Freenet.

**results**

**importance**

**possible properties for a p2p storage oerlay service**: 1) anonymity for
producers; 2) anonymity for consumers; 3) plausible deniability of the files
hosted in the network nodes; 4) high availability; 5) persistence.

**p2p storage services and censorship**: p2p storage overlay services are
resilient to censorship since there are no central/special nodes in which the
network depends on and data may be replicated to many nodes.

**signed subspaces**: by applying pubkey crypto techniques, signed spaces may be
created so that only owner of private key can insert and update information in
the p2p network.

**content indexing/discovery**: lack of centralized services makes it harder to
process keyword storages. indexing has to be performed locally with costs.

**spam in p2p networks**: many freenet overlay services leverage the web of
trust model in which peers share trust scores to their trusted peers. the trust
scores of a peer web of trust are used to avoid spammers and allow trusted peers
to communicate
