### brain dump

This is basically my tech brain dump garbage can. It's easier to solve problems when writing about them. I't also easy to forget the previously arrived solutions. I often find myself digging up solutions for problems which I have solved before but
can't quite remember the solution anymore. So this garbage can contains write ups, tools, code and random thoughts I've put toghether
over the years. Also writeups of papers/articles/books I've read too.
